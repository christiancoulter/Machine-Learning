## DATA STRUCTURES

### List

# List as it's name implies is a list data type. 
# A list can contain similar or mixed types (including another list) of data. 
# A list is implemented in different ways. 
# We will see that in detail in the following example.


#Initialization of a list
myfirstlist = list() #first way
myfirstlist = [] #second way



```
In jupyter notebook environment, commands starting with the symbol % are magic commands or magic functions

%%timeit is one of such function. It basically gives you the speed of execution 

of certain statement or blocks of codes. So lets do following two experiment.
```



%%timeit
myfirstlist = list()

%%timeit 
myfirstlist = []

**Question no.  1: Based on above experiment which one is the fastest? [5 points]**

  Select your answer from the drop-down and run the cell below

fastest = "Select one of the following" #@param ["Select one of the following", "myfirstlist = []", "myfirstlist = list()"]


# range() is one of the inbuilt functions in python. 
# It is super handy to create a list of numbers that ranges from one value to another value.
# We can create a list of range of values in both ascending and descending order.

# Jupyter notebook has a quick way to review the documentation. 
# You have to add '?' before or after the function and run the cell.
# The following both are valid:

# ?range
# range?
# Run the following cell to see the documentation of range
?range

# So now you should know that range takes 3 arguments, (start, end, step)
# But you must be careful that if you provide only one value eg. range(5), 
# your default start is 0
# lets create few lists with the help of range()

list1 = list(range(5)) #Numbers from 0 t o 5 (but not 5, note end is exclusive)
list2 = list(range(5, 10)) #Numbers from 5 to 10 (exclusive end)
list3 = list(range(0, 20, 2)) # Even numbers from 0 to 20 (end is exclusive)

print(list1)
print(list2)
print(list3)

**Question no.  2: Based on what you have learned from above write code for following. [2.5 x 4 = 10 points]**

  Complete the code (Replace the question marks '?' with the right values.)

# even440 is a list of even numbers from 4 to 40 
# being inclusive (must include 40 if 40 is even)
even440 = list(range(?,?,?))
print('even440 : ', even440)

# odd540 is a list of odd numbers from 5 to 40
# being inclusive (must include 40 if 40 is odd)

odd540 = list(range(?,?,?))
print('odd540 : ', odd540)# 1.1 DATA STRUCTURE

# Complete the code a list of multiples of 5 from 25 to 100 
# being inclusive (must include 100 if 100 is a multiple of 5) 
mof5 = list(range(?,?,?))
print('mof5 : ', mof5)

# list from 10 to 0 (must include 10 but not 0)
from10to0 = list(range(?,?,?))
print('from10to0 : ', from10to0)

# List has many methods implemented, 
# and there are inbuilt functions (sorted, max, min ...) you can call on a list.
# In following example we create a random list using the 'random' module
# The method we used here for list construction is called list comprehension

import random
random.seed(4347) #Do not change this seed

x = [random.randint(0,100) for i in range(5)]
print(f'x : {x}') # Note here we use f string, this was introduce in python 3.6x and it is very easier to work with

sortedx = sorted(x)
print(f'sortedx : {sortedx}')

sumofx = sum(x)
print(f'sumofx : {sumofx}')

maxofx = max(x)
print(f'maxofx : {maxofx}')

minofx = min(x)
print(f'minofx : {minofx}')

lenofx = len(x)
print(f'length of x is : {lenofx}')

revofx = list(reversed(x))
print(f'reversed of x is : {revofx}')

# now we have our list x
# to discover methods implemented in the list you can use autocompletion.
# If you type x. in a cell and wait you see a list of available methods.
# if nothing appears press ctrl+space.
# We recommend that you play with few methods, if possible all methods.
# Try to see how each of them works by reading the documentation.
# You now know the trick to open documentation using '?'
x

# following is a code that will print all the methods that are implemented for List
print(dir(list)) # ignore the detail here

# for now ignore methods that starts with '__', they are called dunder methods (or magic methods)
# and they are special methods we use in a class, they are also refered to as data models.
print([*filter(lambda x:not x.startswith('__'),dir(list))]) # ignore the detail here

**Question no.  3: Based on what you have learned from above. Experiment following two functions and explain the difference. Finally create a random list 'x' of size 25? [5 x 2 = 10 points]**

sort() and sorted()

# Code goes here for comparing sort() and sorted()
# Note you can add multiple code cell if you want

#Code goes here for creating a random list of size 25
x = ?

# One of the important things to learn is about indexing of the list.
# list index starts from 0, say you write x[0] 
# it means you are refering to first item of list and x[-1] means 
# you are indexing last item of the list.
# But there are more way you can index a list, e.g. in following way
# x[start:end:step].
# Now you are capable of creating a random list, study following examples 
# and try to answer question no 4 
print(f'x : {x}')
print(f'x from 2 to 5 : {x[2:5]}')
print(f'x from 2 to 25 with step 3 : {x[2:25:3]}')
print(f'last member of x : {x[-1]}')

**Question no.  4: Based on what you have learned from above experiment answer following question, and run the cell? [5 x 3 = 15]**

  

# Select the correct answer and run following cell

isInclusive = "List index start and end values are inclusive" #@param ["List index start and end values are inclusive", "List index start and end are non-inclusive", "Start is inclusive end is not", "End is inclusive start is not"] {allow-input: true}



# Without using the reversed() function, reverse 'x' with the help of indexing
# Code goes here



# Imagine 'listoflist' is a list containing many lists
# What may listoflist[3][8] refer to?

### Tuple

# Tuple is an immutable data structure in python, similar to the list.
# Please do research in the mutable and immutable nature of data structures in python.
# Immutability offers performance advantages over mutable data structures.
# Once a tuple is assigned with some values it is fixed.
# A tuple can be initialized in following ways.
# We don't have any exercise on tuples, please do some research to learn more.
x = tuple()
x = ()

### Set

# Set is a mutable data structure
# Set corresponds to set as in math
# A list allows repeated elements but set does not
# Set has methods built in for set operations like
# Intersection, Union, Set Difference and others
# A list can be converted into set by calling set(x)
# Initializing set
import random
from random import randrange #import this to create a random list
random.seed()

x = set()

randlist = [randrange(0,10) for i in range(20)]
print(f'randlist : {randlist}')

setfromrandlist = set(randlist)
print(f'setfromrandlist : {setfromrandlist}')

# Fundamental Set operations
a = set([randrange(0,50) for i in range(20)])
b = set([randrange(0,50) for i in range(20)])

print(f'a : {a}')
print(f'b : {b}')

union = a.union(b)
intersection = a.intersection(b)
difference = a.difference(b)

print(f'union : {union}')
print(f'intersection : {intersection}')
print(f'difference : {difference}')

# Let us recall a math Problem called as LCM (Lowest Common Multiple)
# Lowest common multiple of numbers is the minimum of the intersection of their multiples
# For example for 3 and 2
# multipleof3 = {3,6,9,12,15,...}
# multipleof2 = {2,4,6,8,10,12,...}
# commonmultiple = {6, 12, ...}
# LCM is minimum of commonmultiple that is 6
# Now using the knowledge of set and list answer following LCM problem

**Question no.  5: Find the LCM of 8, 9 and 12 (use the set and list concepts). [10 points]**

  

# Your code goes here



### Dictionary

# Dictionary is an interesting data structure
# It holds key value pairs
# Values can be accessed by using keys
# Lets see few of the ways to create a dictionary

a = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3, 'd':4}
print(f'a : {a}')

b = dict(zip(['a','b','c','d'], [1,2,3,4]))
print(f'b : {b}')

c = dict(iter([('a',1),('b',2),('c',3),('d',4)]))
print(f'c : {c}')

d = dict(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)
print(f'd : {d}')

# Accessing values using keys in dictionary
print(d['a'])#getting values corresponding to key a

# Study the following code closely 
# Here is a function that returns a value 
# given a key and a dictionary as arguments
# For now you don't have to know the details of 
# how to define a function

# A very simple function
def getfrom(dictionary, keys):
  values = dictionary[keys]
  return values

# Now lets use this function to get values corresponding to key 'a'
# from dictionary 'd'

values = getfrom(dictionary=d, keys='a')
print(f'values correspoding to a is {values}')

# Now lets try to access 'z' which is not in 'd'

values = getfrom(dictionary=d, keys = 'z')
print(f'values correspoding to z is {values}')

# So now you see we have an error, called a key error
# Like list dictionary has different methods implemented 
# like 'clear', 'copy', 'fromkeys', .... and so on
# You now know how to use these methods
# you can use one of these two methods to accomplish following task

**Question no.  6: Complete the function, so that if you don't have a key return 999. [10 points]**

  

# Code goes here

def getfrom(dictionary, keys):
  values = ? #complete your code here
  return values #should return 999 if key doesn't exist

print(getfrom(dictionary=d, keys='z'))

**Question no.  7: Complete the function, so that if you don't have a key return 999 and add 999 to dictionary? [10 points]**

  

# Code goes here

def getfrom(dictionary, keys):
  values = ? #complete your code here
  return values #should return 999 if key doesn't exist and should add to dictionary as well

print(getfrom(dictionary=d, keys='z'))

# Now this shouldn't throw error as 'z' is now set to dictionary
print(d['z'])

## CONTROL FLOWS

### If - else statement
  

# In this section we want to use the conditional statement if - else
# You can use if - else or if-elif-elif-else statement depeneding upon the number of choices
# Example, Note that input will prompt a input box where you have to enter a number and hit enter or return

x = int(input('Enter A Number : ')) #Cast to integer

if x>0:
  print(f'{x} is positive')
elif x<0:
  print(f'{x} is negative')
else:
  print(f'{x} is neither negative nor positive')

**Question no.  8: Based on what you have learned from above, please write following code as instructed. [10 points]**

  

# Set a goal_number variable to some random number
# import randint function from random module and use it
from random import randint
goal_number = randint(1,101)
x = int(input('Guess your random number : '))

assert x in range(1, 101), 'YOUR INPUT MUST BE BETWEEN 1 AND 100 INCLUSIVE'

# Now complete the following code

# If user input is greater than goal_number prompt 'Guess is higher!'
# If user input is smaller than goal_number prompt 'Guess is lower!'
# If user input is equal to the goal_number prompt 'Congratulations you guessed it right!'

# Your code goes below

if ??:
  print(??)
elif ??:
  print(??)
else:
  print(??)

### while loop
  

# Following is a random math expression generator
# Just study this code and don't worry about it 
# We just need it for some math game we are going to make
from time import time
import random
random.seed()

# Generate random symbol
def symbol():
  return random.choice(['+', '-', '*'])

def symbol_():
  return random.choice(['','-'])

# Generate random number from 0 to 10
def num():
  return random.randint(0,10)

rand_exp = f'{symbol_()} {num()} {symbol()} {num()} {symbol()} {num()} {symbol()} {num()}'
print(f'rand_exp : {rand_exp}') 
print(f'solution : {rand_exp} = {eval(rand_exp)}') #We can Evaluate this statement

# Now with the help of above we will design a math-machine-game.
# Basically you have to keep calculating the value of a mathematical expression correctly.
# For every question you are give ten seconds.
# The more questions you answer correctly and the faster, the higher your score. 
# Your total score is the total time you saved out of each ten-second window.
# If you answer a qustion wrong game will end.
# If time is runs out the game will end.
# This is basically a tutorial to make a very simple game.
# You will be using this same idea to make a game that includes guessing a number

def math_machine_game():
  score = 0
  total_time = 10

  while(True):
    rand_exp = f'{symbol_()} {num()} {symbol()} {num()} {symbol()} {num()} {symbol()} {num()}'
    real_value = eval(rand_exp)
    timenow = time() #getting current time

    value = int(input(f'{rand_exp} = '))
    time_elapsed = int(time() - timenow) #just need this to calculate how many secods passed
    intime = time_elapsed < total_time #is this on time??
    print(f'time elapsed = {time_elapsed}')
    print(f'-'*10)
    if intime:
      print(f'Great On Time')
      if real_value == value:

## FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

# In this section we will try to cover some of the powerful aspects of python programming
# In the end you will be asked to do some coding problem based on the content we provided

# First lets start with a [lambda operation]
# A lambda function is an anynymous function. It simply takes some input, processes it and returns it
# You can call it as a one line function as well

# Following is an example of a lambda function that takes a,b -> adds them and returns the sume
sumthem = lambda a,b:a+b
print(f'sumthem(2,3) = {sumthem(2,3)}')


squareit = lambda a:a**2
print(f'squareit(2) = {squareit(2)}')

# It is not advised to use lambda every time, there are specific uses of lambda operations
# To understand this lets discuss another powerful concept called as map

# Lets say we have a list x = [1,3,5,6,7]
# Lets say I wan't to square every element of x
# With for loop following is the solution

x = [1,3,5,6,7]
xsquare = []
for xi in x:
  xsquare.append(xi**2)
print(f'x = {x}')
print(f'xsquare = {xsquare}')

# Well there is a pythonic way to do this, lets use map

squarewithmap = map(lambda a:a**2, x)
print(f'squarewithmap = {squarewithmap}')

# But that will print map object, you need to convert this into list
# You can cast by list(mapobject)
squarewithmap = list(map(lambda a:a**2, x))
print(f'squarewithmap = {squarewithmap}')
# Or,
squarewithmap = [*map(lambda a:a**2, x)]
print(f'squarewithmap = {squarewithmap}')

# Another important thing is 'filter'
# Lets say we want to filter out odd numbers from x 
# We can do this by taking only even numbers 

filtered = [*filter(lambda x:x%2==0,x)]
print(f'filtered = {filtered}')

# There are many other functional aspects, we suggest you to visit the documentation to learn cool stuff
# I would love to add those, but already assignment is too long

**Question no.  14: In this section you are going to use some advance web-scrapping ideas. However you don't have to code anything for that. But you have to post-process the content you get from the internet. This processing includes mapping - filtering and mapping task. This exercise is followed by a given code snippet which rewards you for your hard work. [5 x 3 = 15 points]**

random.sample(tags,10)

# lets grab first item of these tags and see its type
# You will find it is not a 'str' but something else

# We have ommitted many important things about python
# The whole idea of this assignment is to make yourself familiar with python to some level
# Please refer to notes, internet, and official documentation for further knowledge
# You can visit during TA's office hours if you have any questions 

## PANDAS

# In this section we will try to introduce you one of the amazing libraries in python
# Pandas is a python library to deal with tabular data
# To learn more about pandas please visit the documentation, lecture notes or internet

# To work in pandas first we need tabular data
# Since we don't have data now, let's create some fake data
# Faker is a library that can help you make fake data
# Lets start by installing faker and pandas
!pip install Faker
!pip install pandas

# Lets use faker
from faker import Faker
import random
random.seed()
fake = Faker()

#  Lets create some random data of size 100

data = {'name' : [fake.name() for _ in range(100)],
        'company' : [fake.company() for _ in range(100)],
        'salary' : [random.randrange(50000,1000000,10000) for _ in range(100)],
        'address' : [fake.address() for _ in range(100)]}


# See our data
print(data)

# Well, now we can use panda dataframe to make this data more neat
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data = data, columns = data.keys())
df

# Interesting things about this data frame is we can see the summary of data
df.describe()

# So since salary is only a column with numeric values, we get only salary statistics
# You can access each column by following two ways
# Lets access salary
df.salary

# Similarly another way 
df['salary']

# For further more indexing of data frame please review panda documentation
# Now lets do some interesting stuff, lets create a column that has an information about if that person salary is above 500k
df['above500k'] = df.salary > 500000
# Now lets review our dataframe
df.head()

# Now lets say we wan't to do even more complicated stuff
# We wan't to add a status column that has following information
# If salary is between 0 to 500k we will write '0k-500k USD' else we will write '500k-1M USD' in 'status' column
# This can be done easily

df['status'] = df.salary.apply(lambda x:'0k-500k USD' if x in range(0,500000) else '500k-1M USD')

# Now lets see our data frame
df.head()

# Now Lets say we wan't to save our data frame in csv format
# We can do so by following steps
df.to_csv('fakedata.csv', index = None) #I am not preserving index here

# Lets see if we have saved the data frame 
ls

# Now we can read this data frame as well
newdf = pd.read_csv('fakedata.csv')
newdf.head()

# Well there are many more stuff to learn in panda data frame
# But for now you will be doing something similar above

# Following exercise will give you some advance concept in panda dataframe
# You will be asked few things to code at last

# First lets download the data set
!wget https://data.townofcary.org/api/v2/catalog/datasets/rdu-weather-history/exports/csv

# 'csv' is the name of our dataset
ls

df = pd.read_csv('csv', sep = ';')
# Lets see the size of our data
df.shape

df.head()

# Well this is a public data
# There might be many missing values
# Lets see these missing values
df.isna().sum()

# Well there are missing values, lets get rid of them
df = df.dropna()

#Lets check if there is any missing values
df.isna().sum()

# Lets see the shape again
# We lost few rows
df.shape

# Lets see columns of our data
df.columns

# One important thing to notice here is following columns 
'''
'fog', 'fogheavy', 'mist', 'rain', 'fogground', 'ice', 'glaze',
'drizzle', 'snow', 'freezingrain', 'smokehaze', 'thunder', 'highwind',
'hail', 'blowingsnow', 'dust', 'freezingfog'
'''
# These columns are weather information, it will be lot more easier to see these values in one single column called weather
# So we can do this by following code, observe closely what we are doing

tidydf = pd.melt(df,['date', 'temperaturemin', 'temperaturemax', 'precipitation', 'snowfall',
       'snowdepth', 'avgwindspeed', 'fastest2minwinddir',
       'fastest2minwindspeed', 'fastest5secwinddir', 'fastest5secwindspeed'],var_name="weather",value_name="status")

tidydf.head()

# Now we don't need rows that has status 'No' so we will only select rows with 'Yes' status
# Moreover, now we don't  need status column any more so lets drop that column as well
df = tidydf[tidydf.status == 'Yes']
df = df.drop(columns = ['status'])
df.head()

# Now lets describe this data

df.describe()

**Question no.  15: Now write code as instructed.[5 * 6 = 30 points]**

  

# Tast1 : Get rid of following columns
'''
'fastest2minwinddir','fastest2minwindspeed','fastest5secwinddir','fastest5secwindspeed'
'''

# Code goes below
df = 

# Print the head of the data



# Taks2 : Calculate and add 'avgtemperature' column
# Note : avgtemperature is an average of temperaturemin and temperaturemax

# Code goes below
df['avgtemperature'] = 


# Print the head of the data



# Task3 : Now get rid of following two columns
'''
'temperaturemin','temperaturemax'	
'''

# Code goes below
df = 

# Print the head of the data



# Task4 : Now calculate average of all the 'avgtemperature'
# Note you can calculate average like this : df['columname'].mean() or df.columname.mean()

# Code goes below
avgtemp = 



# Task5 : Add a new column called as 'avgtemperature_comaprision'
# Note: if 'avgtemperature' is less than 'avgtemp' fill with 'less than global average'
# if it is greater fill with 'more than global average'

# Code goes below
df['avgtemperature_comaprision'] = 


# Print head of your data



# Task6 : Now save the dataset without index, give a name 'weather.csv'
# Your code goes here



## Numpy

**Question no.  16: Study the given publicly available numpy exercises notebook file and complete the given code. (Note you don't have to go through all notebook, just focus on things you need).[2.5 * 8 = 20 Points]**

# Please refer to following amazing notebook
# https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb
# This notebook will give you fundamental understanding of numpy
# Based on few examples on above notebook Do following

# Create two random numpy array of size 10,10
array1 = ?# now we have our list x
# to discover methods implemented there is a technique
# if you type x. in a cell and wait you see list of methods
# if you nothing appears press ctrl+space
# you are suggested to play with few methods, if possible all methods
# try to see how it works by reading documentation
# you now know the tricks to open documentation using '?'
x
array2 = ?

#Perform simple matrix addition
add12 = ?

# Perform matrix multiplication between these two numpy array
mm12 = ?

# Perform element wise multiplication between these two array
mmelement = ?

## Calculate mean, standard deviation and variance of mm12
mean = ?
std = ?
var = ?


## Visualization

# The following are popular and very useful visualization libraries
# Matplotlib : https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html
# Seaborn : https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html
# Altair : https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html

# For this assignment we will follow the 'Altair' library
# Altair is declarative visualization library, meaning write less get amazing results
# You can see examples from the documentation
# For now we will use some code snippet to see how it works
